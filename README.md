# Internet-Login-Clone-
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the University Internet Login Clone Page project! This repository contains the HTML and CSS code used to create a replica of the login page for our university's internet access. The goal of this project is to practice and showcase skills in web development, specifically focusing on front-end technologies.
